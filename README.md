to test with full manager capabilities - user: admin password: admin123
for testing with only user capabilities - user: user1 password: user123

a regular user can only view the data, whereas the manager can perform various tasks.

using the manager record (admin), you'll be able to create and delete records for the various tabs (participants, events, surveys, etc.)

one thing to note is that for creating a survey, the email needs to be someone listed in the participant list, and the event date and name need to be real. we have been using the event: Mentor Office Hours on 06/23/2024 at 10:00 AM.

if a page seems like its cut off, its because we didn't want to cram everything, and so you'll need to scroll in order to see the entirety of our output(just the events and surveys tab). we still wanted it to look professional so instead of making the page humongous, we instead just kept it within the form.
